## What happens when your PR merges?

- Prefix the title of your PR:
  - `fix:` - tag `main` as a new patch release
  - `feat:` - tag `main` as a new minor release
  - `BREAKING CHANGE:` - tag `main` as a new major release
  - `[MANIFEST]` or `[AUTO-PR]` - tag `main` as a new patch release and deploy to production
  - `chore:` - use for changes to non-app code (ex: GitHub actions)
- Alternatively, change the [VERSION file](https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-manifests/blob/main/VERSION) - this will not create a new tag, but rather will release the tag in `VERSION` to production.
